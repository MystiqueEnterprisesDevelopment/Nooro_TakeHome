In order for the app to run as expected, it requires a Config.xcconfig file that contains a WEATHER_API_KEY with a corresponding api key.
The app is not perfect, and the icons that are returned by the weather api are not the best quality, so they will seem a little bit 
pixelated.

The project should work for both iphone and ipad.
